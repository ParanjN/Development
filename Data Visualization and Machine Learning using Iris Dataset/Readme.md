Just recently to brush up on Data Visualization and Machine Learning concepts, I worked on the Iris dataset. 

For Data Visualization I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create the following graphs:

1) Bar Chart

2) Pie Chart

3) Pair Plot

4) Joint Plot

5) Joint Plot with Regression line

6) Hexadecimal Joint Plot

7) Scatter Plot

8) Histogram

9) Box Plot

10) Violin Plot



Then used following Machine Learning models and checked their accuracy : 

1) Support Vector Machine

2) Logistic Regression

3) Decision Tree

4) K Nearest Neighbor

5) Naive Bayes
